Hello, I am an experienced English teacher and translator with a passion for language and literature. 
I have dedicated myself to helping students master the English language through engaging lessons and personalized instruction. 
In addition to my teaching role, I leverage my linguistic expertise to translate written and spoken content between Chinese and English, ensuring effective communication across diverse audiences. 
My commitment to language education and cultural exchange drives me to excel in both teaching and translation, enriching the lives of those I work with through the power of language.
